Code that allows you to change which LED turns on by adjusting a potentiometer. The 16 bit reading obtained is changed to a percentage which then triggers a respective LED. All these components are linked through the Raspberry Pi Pico W.

From 0-50, the green LED turns on.
From 50-80, the yellow LED turns on.
From 80-100, the red LED turns on.
Outside these values, all the LEDs are off.
