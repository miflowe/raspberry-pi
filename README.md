# Mini Raspberry Pi Projects

A growing collection of hands-on projects built with the Raspberry Pi Pico W and a variety of electronic components.  

Each mini project explores a different hardware or software concept to help me learn, experiment, and document my progress in embedded systems.

Feel free to browse around to see code and demo videos for each project!
